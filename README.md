# fLemonThis is a modified version of the famous Lemon parser generator write specifically for Windows systems featuring some added features.The major advantage is the monolithic constitution including the well known *"lempar.c"* template inside the executable, storing it as a standard resource.The main improvements are the possibility to emit the terminals list as an *enum* instead of classic *#define*, and the emission of prototypes to call the parser.Valid command line options for "flemon" are:  * **-b** Print only the basis in report.  * **-c** Don't compress the action table.  * **-d[string]** Output directory.  Default '.'  * **-D[string]** Define an %ifdef macro.  * **-e** Emit terminals in an enum instead of defines.  * **-f[string]** Ignored.  (Placeholder for -f compiler options.)  * **-g** Print grammar without actions.  * **-I[string]** Ignored.  (Placeholder for '-I' compiler options.)  * **-m** Output a makeheaders compatible file.  * **-l** Do not print #line statements.  * **-O[string]** Ignored.  (Placeholder for '-O' compiler options.)  * **-p** Show conflicts resolved by precedence rules  * **-q** (Quiet) Don't print the report file.  * **-r** Do not sort or renumber states  * **-s** Print parser stats to standard output.  * **-x** Print the version number.  * **-T[string]** Specify a template file.  * **-W[string]** Ignored.  (Placeholder for '-W' compiler options.)
